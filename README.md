Chicken-Runner
==============
Chicken-Runner is an endless runner game written in Java under the MVC architecture. 

Endless running games are platform games in which the player character is continuously moving forward through a procedurally generated, theoretically endless game world. Game controls are limited to making the character jump, attack, or perform special actions. The object of these games is to get as far as possible before the character dies.

How To Play:
--------------
Use the arrows to move and jump. Press the space bar to shoot bullets at enemies and collect apples for points.
